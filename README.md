# cs-c4
The code for my own csgo (or in the near future cs2) bomb replica. You won't do much with it unless you build a circuit just like mine.

Parts used to build the bomb:
- an arduino nano
- an rgb diode
- a 3.7v 660mAh li-po battery
- a buzzer with a generator
- a 4x4 matrix keypad
- an i2c lcd module
- an 16x2 lcd screen
- 3 resistors (220 ohms 5%)
- a half plastic, half wooden box to store everything inside + some glue and screws to make it hold itself
- a bunch of wires (if you want to know how to connect everything, you will have to figure it out yourself, I'm too lazy to make a diagram showing the wiring)
- some stuff to solder everything (idk what, my father was solding everything)
- a universal pcb board
